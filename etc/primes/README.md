# Primes for the RSA algorithm

The core of the RSA algorithm lies in the problem of prime factorization.
In this folder a set of primes (less than 2^8 - 1) can be placed under primes.txt.

Compile the primes_investigator to filter out primes with many ones. 
Many ones in the binary representation of the numbers results in long
computational time in encoding and decoding.
